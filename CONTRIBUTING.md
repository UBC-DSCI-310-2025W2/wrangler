## Core Team Members

Core team members should follow a GitHub Flow branching workflow directly within the main repository:

1. Make sure your local `main` branch is up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix, using a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Short description of your changes"
   ```
4. Push your branch to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
5. Open a pull request against `main` on GitHub. Pull requests will be reviewed within **7 days**.
6. Once approved, your branch will be merged and can then be deleted.
